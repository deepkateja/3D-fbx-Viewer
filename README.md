# 3D-fbx-Viewer

> fbx viewer with three.js for react



```bash
npm install 
```


```



## Local development

1. **clone repo , not install.**


```bash
npm start # runs rollup with watch flag
```
- The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab)
cd example

npm start # runs create-react-app dev server
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your component in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`.

*Note: if you're using yarn, there is no need to use `yarn link`, as the generated module's example includes a local-link by default.*
